Spring Data Cassandra
=====================

This is an alternative for the Hector client that uses the legacy Thrift protocol.
Spring Data Cassandra uses the brand new binary CQL3 protocol with
official DataStax driver (https://github.com/datastax/java-driver).

Native support for CQL3 queries in Spring Repositories.
